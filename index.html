            Hi I'm David, but you can call me infyte! I'm an autistic 20 year old obsessed with Nintendo, and my dream is to make YouTube my career!
            <br><br>
            I've wanted to be a YouTuber since I was 4, inspired by watching videos on my dad's computer. I loved making pretend unboxing videos, showing off my new toys and DVDs, and dreaming of sharing them with the world.
            <br><br>
            When I was 12, I secretly started making YouTube videos. My parents initially told me to delete them, but over time, they saw my dedication. They slowly eased their restrictions, from not allowing me to upload at all, to letting me share my voice, then my camera, and eventually my face, realizing I was determined to keep creating content.
            <br><br>
            In January 2017, my first video hit 1,000 views. By October 2019, I reached 100 subscribers, and in October 2022, just before my 18th birthday, I hit 1,000 subscribersâ€”a childhood dream. In November 2024, I surpassed 4,000 watch hours, joining the YouTube Partner Program and monetizing my content. Now, in December 2024, I have 2,000 subscribers, 850,000 views, and have slowly started making money.
            <br><br>
            I'm so grateful for the support from my family, friends, and everyone who's been part of this journey.
